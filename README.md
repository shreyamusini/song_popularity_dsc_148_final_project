This repository contains all the code and the dataset for our DSC 148 final project.

Our project focuses on testing which model accurately predicts the popularity of songs from a Spotify dataset. The models that are chosen are **LightGBM**, **RandomForestRegressor**, and **XGBoostRegressor**. A **LinearRegression** model served as our baseline for comparing accuracy measurements between machine learning models. As well, feature importance for all models are listed to understand what the model used for determining ratings and compared these features across models for further insight on how it impacts the accuracy of the prediction. 

The file named ml_models_data_cleaning.ipynb contains all the machine learning models and data cleaning performed on our Spotify dataset, which is labeled as dataset_2.csv in this repository. Additionaly, the file named project.ipynb contains all the code and graphs completed for EDA and baseline LinearRegression run.
